Where possible, breeds that are not members of an AKC group were assigned based on close similarity to breeds in that group, using United Kennel Club grouping where applicable.
For example: Anatolian Shepherd is a large Turkish livestock guardian dog in the working group. Kangal and Akbash are similarly large Turkish livestock guardian dogs, and were also assigned to the working group.
Others assigned to a group include the English Shepherd assigned to herding, and the Patterdale Terrier assigned to terrier. 
There are two large groups which were not assigned to any AKC group. 
Pit Bulls, Pit Bull Terriers and American Bulldogs were given the label 'pit bull'.
Blue Lacy, Catahoula Leopard Dog, Black Mouth Cur, Treeing Cur, Tenessee Treeing Brindle and feist were given the label 'cur'. There are no cur breeds in the AKC groups. There are approximately 2000 encounters which involve breeds of this type. They were developed in Texas, Louisiana and some midwestern states, in a very different manner from the development of AKC breeds. The similarities in breed development, genetics, and breed purpose warrant inclusion as a group.
