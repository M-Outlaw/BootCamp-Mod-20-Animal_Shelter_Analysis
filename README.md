# BootCamp-Mod-20-Final_Project

## Project Outline
We will be analyzing animal shelter intake and outake data from Austin, TX with the initial goal to predict the outcome for a dog who enters the shelter.

## Team Members
- Michelle Outlaw
- Anna Wiste
- RoseAnne Amimo
- Jordan Thomas

## Tools and Techniques
We plan to use the following for the project:
- Pandas for data cleaning
- SQL for our database
- Python (SciKitLearn- Machine Learing Classifier Model
- Tableau for dashboard presentation

## Anticipated Challenges
We anticipate that there will be some challenges with cleaning and transforming the data to make it useable for our model. While we do have a large dataset, it is still limited to one city in the US so we do not have a representation of the entire country. Despite this we feel the data is strong enough to make meaningful predictions. Through the evolution of the project it is likely that our initial question that we are asking of the data might change, thus changing the direction of our project. Finally there will be some challenges in ensuring we interpret and present the data in a way that provides value to our identified stakeholders.

## Dataset
The dataset we plan to use includes ~76000 encounters involving dogs at the Austin Animal Center (Austin, TX) from 2013 through the present. 
Data is publicly available through the Austin open data portal. Data is available on [intakes](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Intakes/wter-evkm) and [outcomes](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Outcomes/9t4d-g238). 
Possible outcomes include:
- adoption
- return to owner
- euthanasia
- transfer

Intake fields include:
- date of encounter
- type of encounter (stray, owner surrender, public assist, etc)
- sex 
- age
- breed
- color

Additional features can be extracted/estimated from these fields, including:
- spay/neuter status
- size
- breed type
- breed restriction status
- length of stay
- prior encounters
