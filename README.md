# BootCamp-Mod-20-Final_Project

## Project Outline
We will be analyzing animal shelter intake and outake data from Austin, TX with the initial goal to predict the likelihood that a dog will be adopted.

## Dataset

## Team Members
- Michelle Outlaw
- Anna Wiste
- RoseAnne Amimo
- Jordan Thomas

## Tools and Techniques
We plan to use the following for the project:
- Pandas for data cleaning
- SQL for our database
- Python Machine Learing Classifier Model
- Tableau for dashboard presentation

## Challenges
We anticipate that there will be some challenges with cleaning and transforming the data to make it useable for our model. While we do have a large dataset, it is still limited to one city in the US so we do not have a representation of the entire country. Despite this we feel the data is strong enough to make meaningful predictions. Through the evolution of the project it is likely that our initial question that we are asking of the data might change, thus changing the direction of our project. Finally there will be some challenges in ensuring we interpret and present the data in a way that provides value to our identified stakeholders.
